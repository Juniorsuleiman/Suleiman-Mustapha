In the battle against agricultural pests, understanding the intricate interactions between insects and plants is crucial for developing effective pest management strategies. One such pest, the cabbage aphid (*Brevicoryne brassicae*), is notorious for its impact on cabbage crops worldwide, causing significant yield losses and transmitting plant viruses. Recent research has delved into the behavioural and electrophysiological responses of these aphids to odours emitted by host plants, providing new insights that could pave the way for innovative pest control methods.

**The Role of Plant Odors in Aphid Behaviour**

Plants have evolved sophisticated defence mechanisms to cope with herbivore attacks, one of which is the emission of specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when under attack. These compounds, known as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), can serve as signals to attract natural enemies of the herbivores or to communicate with other plants. However, these same volatiles can also be exploited by herbivores like aphids to locate suitable host plants.

In a recent study, we investigated how cabbage aphids respond to odours from cabbage plants infested by conspecifics (other cabbage aphids) and heterospecific (other competition like the diamondback moth, *Plutella xylostella*), as well as odours from uninfested plants and aphids themselves. The findings shed light on the complex olfactory cues that guide aphid behaviour and could inform the development of new pest management strategies (see Mustapha et al., 2024).

Odors from both aphids (left) and cabbage plants (right) were collected using a technique known as air entrainment. This method allows scientists to capture and analyse volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by the aphids and plants, enabling the identification of specific chemical cues involved in insect-plant interactions.

**Key Findings: Attraction to Conspecific-Infested Plants**

Using a combination of behavioural assays and advanced techniques like gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD), we found that cabbage aphids are primarily attracted to odours emitted by cabbage plants infested with other aphids. This suggests that aphids may use these conspecific-induced volatiles as cues to locate already infested plants, where they can aggregate and potentially overwhelm the plant's defences.

Interestingly, while aphids also showed some attraction to odours from uninfested plants and those infested by the diamondback moth, the response was strongest towards conspecific-infested plants. This indicates a preference that could be exploited in pest management strategies, such as using synthetic versions of these volatiles cues to lure aphids away from crops.

Behavioural responses of aphids to various odour cues were studied using an olfactometer (left), while an electroantennographic detector, coupled with gas chromatography, was used to expose the insect's antennae to chemical compounds to identify those that elicit an antenna response (right).

**Implications for Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**

The insights gained from this study have important implications for the development of integrated pest management (IPM) approaches. By understanding the specific volatiles that attract aphids, it may be possible to create targeted lures or repellents that can be used in traps or as part of a push-pull strategy to manage aphid populations more effectively.

Moreover, this research highlights the importance of considering the behavioural ecology of pests in IPM programs. As aphids are shown to respond differently to various plant-induced volatiles, IPM strategies can be tailored to exploit these preferences, reducing reliance on chemical insecticides and minimizing their environmental impact.

**Conclusion**

This study represents a significant step forward in understanding the olfactory-driven behaviours of cabbage aphids and their interactions with host plants. As we continue to explore the chemical ecology of pests, we move closer to developing sustainable, ecologically sound methods for managing agricultural pests and protecting crops. The future of pest management lies in such innovative approaches, where science and nature work hand in hand to ensure food security.
